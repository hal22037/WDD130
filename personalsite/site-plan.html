       Thrift stores tend to have the best prices, but it can be hard to find good clothes at most thrift/resale stores. At Goodwill or Deseret Industries, they accept almost everything they recieve from the community and do not pay you which can have negative effects on the quality of the items there. At Platos's Closet, we take pride in offering the best quality clothing by incentivizing people to sell us good quality clothing by paying cash. At our store, there are 2 processes that you can accompish. You can shop for less or you can earn cash for your clothes. For more in depth information about these 2 processes, use this home page to naviagate to your desired information!

      <h3>CASH for YOUR Apparel/Accesories</h3>
      <p>
        Do you ever look in your closet and think that you have way too many clothes, shoes, purses, hats, jewerly, or more? On top of this, do you ever feel like you would have no luck seling them yourself? Well, your solution is Plato's Closet. Our company will allow you to bring in as many items as you would like, and one of our amazing workers will go through your items and pick out anything that we are able to resell in our store. This allows you to earn cash from your clothes, while also helping recycle clothing to help others and the environment. The only requirements to sell at our store are: having no rips, stains, tears, holes or pilling on any of your items, as well as making sure they are freshly laundered upon selling with us.

      <h3>SPEND Way LESS When You Shop</h3>
      <p>
        Even if you aren't a regular shopper, our store will make you want to shop more because of the unmatched low prices that we have! These items are second hand, which allows us to price them a lot lower than retail price. Our man pritorities are to get you as our customer the lowest price we can, and convincing people to recycle their own clothing. When you shop at our store, we tend to even have deals that can be up to 90% off during certain times of the year. On top of this, we consistently hold back our best of the best items, so that we can drop all of the best items under your favorite brands on specific days.  This allows you to save time, money and allows you to come in on days that we are dropping your favorite brands.
