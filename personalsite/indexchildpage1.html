    <h1>CASH for YOUR Apparel/Accesories</h1>
    <p>Do you ever look in your closet and think that you have way too many clothes, shoes, purses, hats, jewerly, or more? On top of this, do you ever feel like you would have no luck seling them yourself? Well, your solution is Plato's Closet. Our company will allow you to bring in as many items as you would like, and one of our amazing workers will go through your items and pick out anything that we are able to resell in our store. This allows you to earn cash from your clothes, while also helping recycle clothing to help others and the environment. The only requirements to sell at our store are: having no rips, stains, tears, holes or pilling on any of your items, as well as making sure they are freshly laundered upon selling with us.<p>
        <p>Do you have too many clothes and need some extra cash? Plato’s Closet in Bismarck needs more male clothing, and they just might be able to help you out. Plato’s Closet buys and sells gently used clothes and accessories; all the latest styles and trends for up to 70% off mall prices. The shop accepts over 1,000 different brands including Abercrombie, Shein, Zara and H&M. Store Manager Terra Schane says you can bring in clothes that you don’t want and they’ll buy them. All clothing must be up in good condition, which makes it more difficult to get a large amount of male clothing coming in. “Guys do kind of wear out their clothes and tend to want to keep certain pieces,” said Schane. So instead of wearing that same old T-shirt, the store wants you to sell it to them. Schane says Plato’s Closet requests items don’t have any stains, holes, peeling or fading to them</p>
