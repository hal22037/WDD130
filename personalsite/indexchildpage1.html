    <h3>Do you ever look in your closet and think that you have way too many clothes, shoes, purses, hats, jewerly, or more? On top of this, do you ever feel like you would have no luck seling them yourself? Well, your solution is Plato's Closet. Our company will allow you to bring in as many items as you would like, and one of our amazing workers will go through your items and pick out anything that we are able to resell in our store. This allows you to earn cash from your clothes, while also helping recycle clothing to help others and the environment. The only requirements to sell at our store are: having no rips, stains, tears, holes or pilling on any of your items, as well as making sure they are freshly laundered upon selling with us.</h3>
