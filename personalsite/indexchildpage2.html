    <h1>SPEND Way LESS When You Shop</h1>
    <p>Even if you aren't a regular shopper, our store will make you want to shop more because of the unmatched low prices that we have! These items are second hand, which allows us to price them a lot lower than retail price. Our man pritorities are to get you as our customer the lowest price we can, and convincing people to recycle their own clothing. When you shop at our store, we tend to even have deals that can be up to 90% off during certain times of the year. On top of this, we consistently hold back our best of the best items, so that we can drop all of the best items under your favorite brands on specific days. This allows you to save time, money and allows you to come in on days that we are dropping your favorite brands.<p>
        <p>Plato’s Closet usually has clearance sales at the start of each season and on holidays, but depending on their inventory, may have more. Also, each store holds their own sale events, since they’re franchises. For example, some Plato’s Closet stores hold a back-to-school tailgate sale event every July and August. Clearance prices change regularly with their sales. They are usually at least 50% off their regular prices but can also go up to 90%. They usually will have a rack dedicated to just clearance, but it’s always a good habit to double-check the tag to make sure it wasn’t misplaced.</p>
