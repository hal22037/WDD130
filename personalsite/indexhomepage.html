    <h3>Thrift stores tend to have the best prices, but it can be hard to find good clothes at most thrift/resale stores. At Goodwill or Deseret Industries, they accept almost everything they recieve from the community and do not pay you which can have negative effects on the quality of the items there. At Platos's Closet, we take pride in offering the best quality clothing by incentivizing people to sell us good quality clothing by paying cash. At our store, there are 2 processes that you can accompish. You can shop for less or you can earn cash for your clothes. For more in depth information about these 2 processes, use this home page to naviagate to your desired information!</h3>
